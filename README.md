My early React steps:

* Install dependencies from `package.json`: `npm install`
* Update `PATH` to include npm bin directory: `PATH="$(npm bin):$PATH"`
* Bundle and pre-process JSX: `webpack --watch`
* Serve content: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
* visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
* Click "Do Something"
